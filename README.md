Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I have create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.
Requirement 1: Created Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed
Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
To fulfill the second requirement, computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.
Part 2: VacationPy
Created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
Created a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.
Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
